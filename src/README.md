# Introduction

This NuGet package provides reference implementations for various algorithms and data structures teached
at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at) in the [MultiMediaTechnology degree program](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/studium/ct/multimediatechnology-bachelor)
within the lecture Algorithms and Data Structures.

All implementations are stacking on each other. That means if a complex data structure / algorithm uses other data structures they are provided as reference implementation as well.

Most of the ideas are from Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition, September 2009.

## Impleted Algorithms

- Graphs (Breadth First Search / Depth First Search / Dijkstra)
- Minimal Spanning Trees (Prim / Kruskal)
- Sorting (Insertion Sort / Merge Sort / Quick Sort)
- String Similarity (Jaro Winkler)

## Implemented Data Structures

- Double Linked List
- Stack / Queue
- Priority Queue
- Dictionary / Hash Table
- Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree
- Min Heap
- Union Find
- Graph / Weighted Graph
